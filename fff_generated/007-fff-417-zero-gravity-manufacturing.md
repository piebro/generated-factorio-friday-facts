# Friday Facts #417 - Zero-gravity manufacturing

Hello engineers!

Today we're going to dive into one of the most exciting aspects of Factorio: Space Age - zero-gravity manufacturing processes. As you venture beyond Nauvis and establish your presence in space, you'll encounter new challenges and opportunities that come with manufacturing in a weightless environment.

### The challenges of zero-g manufacturing

When we first started designing the space manufacturing mechanics, we quickly realized that simply transplanting our existing assembly processes into space wouldn't be enough. The absence of gravity introduces a whole new set of problems that need innovative solutions.

1. **Component Handling**: In a gravity-free environment, items don't naturally fall onto conveyor belts or stay put in machines. We had to develop new methods for containing and directing components.

2. **Fluid Dynamics**: Liquids behave very differently in space. No more relying on gravity-fed pipes!

3. **Heat Dissipation**: Without convection currents, heat management becomes a critical concern for your space factories.

4. **Precision Assembly**: Some manufacturing processes actually benefit from the lack of gravitational interference, allowing for more precise construction of delicate components.

### Magnetic Containment Systems

To address the issue of floating components, we've introduced a new technology: Magnetic Containment Systems (MCS). These systems use electromagnetic fields to guide and contain items within your space factories.

MCS comes in different tiers, each offering improved control and efficiency:

- **Tier 1**: Basic containment, suitable for simple manufacturing processes.
- **Tier 2**: Enhanced control, allowing for more complex item routing.
- **Tier 3**: Precision fields, enabling the manufacture of advanced space-only components.

### Fluid Handling in Space

Dealing with fluids in zero gravity required a complete overhaul of our fluid systems. We've introduced new pressurized tanks and pumps that can accurately measure and dispense liquids without relying on gravity.

One exciting aspect of this system is the ability to create perfect spheres of liquid, which can be manipulated for specific manufacturing processes. This opens up possibilities for new recipes and products that are only possible in a zero-g environment.

### Thermal Management

Heat dissipation in space is primarily through radiation, which is much less efficient than convection or conduction. To tackle this, we've developed new heat management systems:

1. **Radiator Panels**: Large, deployable panels that efficiently radiate heat into space.
2. **Heat Pipes**: Specialized pipes that can transfer heat from your machines to the radiator panels.
3. **Thermal Regulation Modules**: Advanced systems that can precisely control the temperature of your space factories.

### New Manufacturing Possibilities

The unique conditions of space allow for entirely new manufacturing processes. Here are a few examples of what you can look forward to:

1. **Crystal Growth**: Perfect crystals can be grown in zero-g, essential for advanced electronics and optical components.
2. **Alloy Mixing**: The absence of buoyancy allows for the creation of perfectly mixed metal alloys.
3. **Biological Cultivation**: Certain organisms thrive in microgravity, opening up new possibilities for bio-engineering.

### Balancing Act

Introducing these new mechanics while keeping the game balanced and enjoyable has been a significant challenge. We've had to carefully consider how these space-only processes integrate with the existing gameplay loop.

For example, while some products can only be manufactured in space, they often require precursor components made on planetary surfaces. This creates an interesting logistical challenge of balancing your production between different environments.

### The Future of Space Manufacturing

As we continue to develop and refine these systems, we're excited about the possibilities they open up. The zero-gravity environment allows for some truly creative and mind-bending factory designs that we can't wait to see you create.

We're also exploring ideas for late-game technologies that could allow you to create localized gravity fields, giving you even more control over your space manufacturing processes. But that's a topic for another FFF!
