# Friday Facts #417 - Orbital Recycling

Hello engineers,

Today we're excited to share with you a new gameplay mechanic that's coming to Factorio: Space Age - Orbital Recycling!

### The Problem of Space Junk

As you've been expanding your factory into space, you may have noticed that your platforms are getting a bit... cluttered. All those spent rocket stages, broken machinery, and leftover construction materials don't just disappear. In the vacuum of space, there's no convenient way to dispose of waste. Until now.

### Introducing the Orbital Recycler

The Orbital Recycler is a new structure that you can build on your space platforms. It's designed to break down space debris and unwanted items into their base components, allowing you to reuse materials that would otherwise be lost to the void.

The Orbital Recycler works by using powerful lasers and magnetic fields to break down items at the molecular level. It can process a wide variety of materials, from simple iron plates to complex electronic components. However, it's not 100% efficient - you'll always lose some material in the recycling process.

### How it Works

To use the Orbital Recycler, simply connect it to your logistics network and set up a filter for the items you want to recycle. The recycler will automatically pull in those items and begin breaking them down. The resulting raw materials will be output on the other side, ready to be used in your space factory once again.

The recycler has different efficiency rates for different types of materials. Simple items like plates and gears have a high recycling efficiency, while more complex items like processing units will yield fewer usable materials. This creates an interesting trade-off - is it worth recycling that stack of advanced circuits, or should you find a way to use them instead?

### Strategic Implications

The introduction of the Orbital Recycler opens up new strategic possibilities for managing your space economy:

1. **Resource Loop**: By recycling items you no longer need, you can create a closed loop of resources in space, reducing your reliance on constant resupply from the planet's surface.

2. **Space Management**: The ability to recycle unwanted items means you can be more liberal with your construction in space, knowing that you can always reclaim the resources later if needed.

3. **Upgrading Incentive**: As you research better recycling technologies, you'll be able to more efficiently break down old equipment. This creates an incentive to upgrade your space infrastructure regularly.

4. **Crisis Management**: If you find yourself running low on a crucial resource in space, you can now recycle non-essential items to obtain it, potentially saving a mission from disaster.

### Balancing and Research

We've carefully balanced the Orbital Recycler to ensure it doesn't trivialize resource management in space. The initial recycler you can build will have relatively low efficiency, but through research, you can improve its capabilities:

- **Molecular Disassembly**: Improves overall recycling efficiency by 10%.
- **Quantum Reclamation**: Allows recycling of more complex items like rocket parts.
- **Zero-G Material Extraction**: Increases the recycling speed by 50%.
- **Nano-scale Refinement**: Further improves recycling efficiency for all items by 15%.

### The Art of Space Junk

Creating the visuals for the Orbital Recycler and the recycling process was an interesting challenge. We wanted to convey the high-tech nature of the process while still fitting into the Factorio aesthetic.

The recycler itself features a central chamber where items are broken down, surrounded by various energy emitters and containment fields. As items are recycled, you can see them being disintegrated in a shower of particles, which are then funneled into output ports.

Our artists put a lot of effort into making the recycling process visually satisfying. You'll see different effects based on the type of item being recycled - metals might spark and glow, while electronic components will emit brief flashes of light as their circuits are deconstructed.

### Modding Potential

As with all major features in Factorio, we've designed the Orbital Recycler with modding in mind. Modders will be able to define custom recycling recipes for their own items, adjust recycling efficiencies, and even create entirely new types of recyclers if they wish.

We're excited to see what the modding community does with this new mechanic!

### Conclusion

The Orbital Recycler adds a new layer of depth to resource management in space, encouraging players to think carefully about how they use and reuse materials. We believe it will make the late-game space exploration phase of Factorio: Space Age even more engaging and challenging.

We're still fine-tuning the balance and visuals of the Orbital Recycler, so your feedback will be crucial as we move towards release. Let us know what you think about this new mechanic and how you plan to incorporate it into your space factories!

As always, we'll be reading your comments and ideas in the usual places.
