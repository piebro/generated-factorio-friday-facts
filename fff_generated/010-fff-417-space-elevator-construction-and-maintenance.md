# Friday Facts #417 - Space Elevator Construction and Maintenance

Hello engineers!

Today we're excited to share some details about one of the most ambitious structures you'll be building in Factorio: Space Age - the space elevator. This colossal feat of engineering will serve as your primary means of transporting resources and personnel between the surface and your orbital platforms.

### The Basics

The space elevator consists of three main components:

1. The ground station
2. The cable
3. The counterweight

Building this megastructure is no small task and will require significant resources and planning. Let's break down each component and the challenges they present.

#### Ground Station

The ground station serves as the anchor point for the elevator cable and houses the machinery necessary for payload transport. It's a massive structure that needs to withstand enormous tensile forces.

Construction of the ground station is a multi-stage process. You'll start by laying a reinforced foundation, then build up the main structure layer by layer. Each stage requires specific materials and components, many of which you'll need to manufacture on-site.

The ground station also includes a sophisticated control center. From here, you'll manage elevator operations, schedule cargo transfers, and monitor the structural integrity of the entire system.

#### The Cable

The elevator cable is perhaps the most critical and technologically advanced component of the entire system. It needs to be incredibly strong yet lightweight, capable of supporting its own weight plus cargo over a distance of tens of thousands of kilometers.

In Factorio: Space Age, we've introduced a new material called "nanocarbon filament" specifically for this purpose. Producing this advanced material will be one of your primary challenges when constructing the elevator.

The cable is constructed in segments, each requiring a significant amount of nanocarbon filament. As you build upwards, you'll need to carefully manage the tension in the cable to prevent catastrophic failure.

#### The Counterweight

At the top of the elevator sits the counterweight, which helps balance the forces acting on the cable and provides a terminus for cargo and personnel transfers to your orbital platforms.

The counterweight station is essentially a small space station in its own right. It includes docking ports for your space platforms, storage facilities, and power generation systems to keep the elevator running smoothly.

### Maintenance and Upgrades

Once your space elevator is operational, the challenge shifts from construction to maintenance and upgrades. The elevator is a complex system with many potential points of failure, and keeping it running smoothly is crucial for your interplanetary logistics.

We've introduced a new type of robot specifically for space elevator maintenance. These bots can traverse the length of the cable, performing repairs and upgrades as needed. You'll need to keep them supplied with spare parts and energy cells, which adds another layer of logistical challenge to your base.

The elevator's capacity can be upgraded over time by adding additional cables and improving the ground station's infrastructure. Each upgrade increases the elevator's throughput, allowing you to transport more resources and personnel between the surface and orbit.

### Gameplay Impact

The space elevator fundamentally changes how you approach space exploration and resource management. It provides a constant, energy-efficient method of moving materials between planets and your orbital platforms.

However, it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Damage to the elevator from asteroid impacts or other hazards can disrupt your entire supply chain. Protecting and maintaining this vital infrastructure becomes a key part of your strategy.

We're excited to see how players will incorporate the space elevator into their factories and the creative solutions they'll come up with for the new challenges it presents.

### Conclusion

The space elevator represents a significant investment of time and resources, but it opens up new possibilities for expanding your factory beyond the confines of a single planet. We believe it adds a new dimension to the game that fits perfectly with the "ever-expanding factory" ethos of Factorio.

We're still fine-tuning various aspects of the space elevator, from construction logistics to maintenance gameplay. Your feedback, as always, will be invaluable in this process.
