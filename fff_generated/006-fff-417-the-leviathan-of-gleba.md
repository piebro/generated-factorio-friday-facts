# Friday Facts #417 - The Leviathan of Gleba

Hello engineers,

Last week we delved into the intricacies of our new fluid system. This week, we're taking a dive into the murky waters of Gleba to introduce you to one of its most formidable inhabitants.

### A New Threat Emerges

As you explore the swampy landscapes of Gleba, you might have noticed the eerie silence that occasionally falls over the planet's cacophony of alien sounds. Today, we're excited to reveal the source of that silence: the Leviathan.

The Leviathan is a massive amphibious creature that lurks beneath the surface of Gleba's numerous bodies of water. Its presence is often first detected by a distinct splashing sound, followed by earth-shaking stomps as it emerges from the depths.

### Underwater Terror

Unlike the biters of Nauvis, the Leviathan spends most of its time submerged, making it a unique challenge for players. Its massive size allows it to traverse both land and water with ease, giving it a significant advantage over traditional defenses.

When submerged, the Leviathan is nearly invisible, with only subtle ripples on the water's surface hinting at its presence. This makes early detection crucial for survival.

### The Stomp Heard 'Round the Planet

One of the Leviathan's most distinctive features is its thunderous stomp. As it approaches, players will hear a series of increasingly loud stomps, each one more menacing than the last.

These stomps serve a dual purpose. Not only do they strike fear into the hearts of would-be colonizers, but they also have a practical effect on the gameplay. Each stomp creates a shockwave that can damage nearby structures and stun smaller creatures, including the player character.

### Defensive Strategies

Dealing with the Leviathan will require new tactics and technologies. Traditional walls and turrets may not be enough to keep this behemoth at bay.

We've introduced a new sonar technology that can help detect underwater movement, giving players a fighting chance at early warning. Additionally, we've developed new amphibious vehicles and weapons specifically designed to combat this new threat.

### Environmental Impact

The Leviathan isn't just a new enemy to fight; it's an integral part of Gleba's ecosystem. Its movements and activities can dramatically alter the landscape, creating new challenges and opportunities for resourceful players.

For example, a Leviathan's passage through a swampy area might create new waterways, changing the layout of the terrain. This dynamic environment adds an extra layer of strategy to base building and resource management on Gleba.

### Sound Design

Creating the audio for the Leviathan was a unique challenge. We wanted to capture the sense of dread and anticipation as the creature approaches, as well as the sheer power of its emergence from the water.

Our sound team spent weeks recording and mixing various animal sounds, underwater explosions, and even the creaking of large ships to create the Leviathan's distinctive audio profile.

The result is a creature that you can hear long before you see, adding to the tension and excitement of exploring Gleba.

### Balancing Act

Introducing such a powerful new enemy presented some interesting balancing challenges. We've been carefully testing and adjusting the Leviathan's attributes to ensure it provides a significant challenge without being insurmountable.

Players will need to adapt their strategies and prioritize certain technologies to effectively deal with this new threat. We believe this adds an exciting new dimension to the mid and late-game stages of Space Age.

### Looking Ahead

The Leviathan is just one of many new creatures and challenges awaiting players on Gleba. We're excited to see how the community adapts to this new threat and the creative solutions they come up with to defend against it.

In the coming weeks, we'll be sharing more details about the other unique flora and fauna of Gleba, as well as the new technologies players will have at their disposal to survive and thrive on this alien world.
