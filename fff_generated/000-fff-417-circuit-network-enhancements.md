# Friday Facts #417 - Circuit Network Enhancements

Hello engineers,
Today we're excited to share some improvements coming to the circuit network in Factorio 2.0. We've been working on expanding its capabilities and making it more user-friendly, so let's dive in!

### Improved Circuit Network UI

One of the most requested features has been a better interface for working with circuit networks. We're happy to announce that we've completely overhauled the circuit network UI to make it more intuitive and powerful.

The new interface allows you to see all connected entities at a glance, with clearer indications of input and output signals. We've also added a search function to quickly find specific signals or entities in complex setups.

### New Combinators

We're introducing two new types of combinators to expand the possibilities of circuit networks:

#### Memory Combinator

The Memory Combinator allows you to store and retrieve values, acting like a simple database for your factory. This opens up new possibilities for complex logistics and production management.

In this example, the Memory Combinator is used to keep track of item requests across multiple outposts, ensuring efficient resource distribution.

#### Delay Combinator

The Delay Combinator introduces a time element to your circuits. It can hold a signal for a specified number of ticks before outputting it, allowing for more precise timing in your automation.

Here, the Delay Combinator is used to create a pulsing effect in a lamp circuit, demonstrating its potential for creating timed events.

### Circuit Network Visualizer

To help debug complex circuit networks, we've added a new visualization tool. When activated, it shows the flow of signals through your network in real-time.

The visualization uses color-coded arrows to represent different signal types, making it easier to track how information moves through your factory.

### Performance Improvements

We've also made significant performance improvements to the circuit network system. Large-scale circuit networks now have much less impact on UPS (updates per second), allowing for even more complex automation in mega-factories.

This graph shows the improved performance of circuit networks in a large factory setup before and after optimization.

### Circuit Network Blueprints

Finally, we're introducing the ability to create and share circuit network blueprints. This feature allows you to save complex circuit setups and easily recreate them in different parts of your factory or share them with other players.

Watch as a complex circuit network is instantly recreated using a blueprint, saving time and reducing errors in repetitive setups.

### Conclusion

These enhancements to the circuit network system are aimed at giving you more control and creativity in automating your factory. Whether you're a circuit network novice or an automation expert, we believe these new features will open up exciting possibilities for your Factorio creations.

As always, we're eager to hear your thoughts on these changes. How do you plan to use the new combinators? What complex automation challenges are you looking forward to solving with these enhancements?
