# Friday Facts #417 - Celestia: The Clockwork Planet

Hello,
Today we're excited to unveil the fourth planet in Space Age: Celestia, the Clockwork Planet.

### Welcome to Celestia

As your spacecraft descends through the cloudy atmosphere, you catch glimpses of a world unlike any you've seen before. The entire surface seems to be covered in intricate machinery, gears of various sizes meshing together in perfect synchronization. As you land, the ground beneath you hums with a steady, rhythmic vibration.

Stepping out of your craft, you're immediately struck by the crisp, cool air and the faint scent of oil and metal. The sky above is a pale blue, occasionally obscured by wispy clouds that move in unnaturally straight lines. All around you, as far as the eye can see, is an endless expanse of brass, copper, and steel.

Enormous gears, some as tall as buildings, rotate slowly in the distance. Closer inspection reveals that even the ground you're standing on is composed of smaller, interlocking cogs. Pistons rise and fall in a hypnotic dance, while conveyor belts snake their way across the landscape, carrying mysterious components to unknown destinations.

As you explore further, you discover pockets of crystalline structures jutting out from the mechanical terrain. These crystals pulsate with an inner light, seemingly in tune with the planet's rhythmic movements. You realize that these are likely the power source for this vast planetary machine.

In the valleys between the larger gear structures, you find clusters of clockwork beings. These autonomous machines vary in size and complexity, from small, scurrying gear-mice to larger, more intricate clockwork guardians. They seem to be maintaining and repairing the surrounding machinery, their movements precise and purposeful.

As night falls, the true beauty of Celestia reveals itself. The crystals glow brighter, casting a soft, multicolored light across the metallic landscape. The gears and pistons are illuminated from within, creating a mesmerizing light show as they continue their eternal dance.

But Celestia is not just a marvel to behold – it's a complex system waiting to be understood and harnessed. The challenge that lies ahead is clear: how will you integrate your factory with this vast planetary machine?

### Celestial Mechanics

On Celestia, the traditional rules of production are turned on their head. Instead of placing assemblers and inserters wherever you please, you'll need to work within the constraints – and opportunities – presented by the planet's existing machinery.

#### Gear Networks

The most fundamental aspect of Celestia's production is the gear network. Large sections of the planet's surface are covered in interlocking gears of various sizes. By placing your machines strategically on these gears, you can create complex production chains without the need for belts or inserters.

Items are transferred from one machine to another as the gears rotate, with careful timing required to ensure smooth operation. The speed of production is directly tied to the rotation speed of the gears, which can be adjusted using special regulator buildings.

#### Crystal Power

Forget about coal, oil, or nuclear power – on Celestia, everything runs on crystal energy. The pulsating crystals you encountered earlier are the planet's power source, and learning to harness them efficiently is key to your success.

Crystal Reactors are a new type of power generation building unique to Celestia. They draw energy from nearby crystals, converting their pulsations into usable electricity. However, the crystals have limited capacity and will eventually deplete if overused. Part of the challenge is balancing power consumption with crystal regeneration.

#### Clockwork Assemblers

Traditional assembling machines won't work on Celestia's gear-covered surface. Instead, you'll use Clockwork Assemblers – specialized machines that integrate seamlessly with the gear networks.

These assemblers are modular, allowing you to add or remove gears to change their crafting speed and energy consumption. By carefully designing your gear layouts, you can create highly efficient production lines that make the most of Celestia's unique mechanics.

#### The Synchronizer

At the heart of your Celestian factory will be the Synchronizer, a massive structure that allows you to control the timing and flow of the entire gear network.

The Synchronizer lets you fine-tune the rotation speeds of different gear sections, create pauses in the production cycle, and even reverse the flow of items when needed. Mastering this building is crucial for optimizing your factory's performance.

### Celestial Science

Of course, no new planet would be complete without its own unique science pack. On Celestia, you'll be producing Chronometric Science Packs.

These intricate devices require precise timing to assemble, making full use of the gear network's capabilities. The research they unlock focuses on further manipulating time and space, opening up new possibilities for both Celestia and your entire space empire.

### Design Challenges

Creating Celestia presented us with some unique challenges. We wanted to make a planet that felt truly alien and mechanical, while still providing engaging gameplay that fit with Factorio's core concepts.

The gear network system required a complete overhaul of how items are moved and machines interact. Our programmers had to create new pathing algorithms to handle item transfer across the rotating gears, ensuring that items always end up where they're supposed to go.

Visually, we wanted Celestia to be a feast for the eyes without becoming overwhelming or hard to read. Our artists spent countless hours fine-tuning the gear designs, crystal effects, and overall color palette to strike the right balance.

### Conclusion

Celestia represents a new frontier in factory design, challenging players to think in new ways about production, timing, and efficiency. We can't wait to see the incredible clockwork creations our community will come up with!

In our next FFF, we'll delve deeper into some of the unique technologies you'll research on Celestia, and how they tie into the broader Space Age expansion. Until then, keep those gears turning!

As always, let your thoughts tick and tock in the usual places.
