# Friday Facts #417 - Fulgoran Threats

Hello engineers,
Today we're diving into some of the new challenges you'll face on Fulgora. It's not just the environment that's out to get you!

* * *

### Remnants of the Past

As you explore the ruins of Fulgora, you may notice that not everything is as abandoned as it first appears. The ancient civilization that once called this planet home left behind more than just crumbling structures and valuable scrap. Some of their autonomous systems are still active, and they don't take kindly to intruders.

These robotic guardians come in various forms, each presenting a unique threat to your operations. Let's take a closer look at what you'll be up against.

### Scavenger Drones

The most common threat you'll encounter are the Scavenger Drones. These small, nimble robots were likely once used for maintenance and resource collection. Now, they see your factory as nothing more than a treasure trove of parts to pilfer.

Scavenger Drones will swoop in and attempt to steal items directly from your belts and storage containers. They're fast and can be difficult to hit, but fortunately they're not very durable. A few well-placed shots from a submachine gun can take them down.

The real danger comes from their numbers. While a single drone might only make off with a handful of iron plates, a swarm of them can seriously disrupt your production lines if left unchecked.

To combat these mechanical menaces, you'll need to set up proper defenses around your base perimeter. Turrets loaded with standard ammunition can be effective, but for the best results, you'll want to harness the power of Fulgora itself.

### Lightning Guns

Remember those lightning rods and collectors we talked about in [FFF-399](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-399)? Well, they're not just for powering your base. With a bit of Fulgoran ingenuity, you can turn that raw electrical energy into a formidable weapon.

The Lightning Gun is a new turret type unique to Fulgora. It harnesses the intense electrical storms that rage across the planet's surface, focusing that energy into devastating bolts that can fry multiple enemies at once. These weapons are particularly effective against the robotic threats you'll face, as the electrical discharge can short-circuit their systems.

Lightning Guns require a constant supply of power to function, so you'll need to carefully manage your energy network to keep them operational. However, their area-of-effect damage and ability to chain between targets make them invaluable for defending against swarms of smaller enemies.

### Hostile Construction Bots

As you push further into the ruins and begin to establish larger outposts, you may encounter a more insidious threat: Hostile Construction Bots. These corrupted versions of the helpful robots we all know and love are a grim reminder of how far the ancient Fulgoran civilization fell.

Unlike the Scavenger Drones, which merely steal loose items, these rogue construction bots will actively deconstruct your structures. They operate much like your own bots, systematically taking apart buildings and returning the materials to their base of operations.

These "hives" are actually automated assembly machines that use the stolen resources to produce more hostile bots. If left unchecked, a single hive can quickly become a major problem, fielding an ever-growing army of destructive robots.

Dealing with Hostile Construction Bots requires a multi-faceted approach:

1. Establish a strong perimeter defense to prevent them from reaching your structures.
2. Use radar and scouting to locate and destroy their hives before they become too entrenched.
3. Employ your own construction bots to quickly repair any damage they manage to inflict.

One interesting strategy that has emerged from our playtesting is using decoy structures. By building simple, resource-cheap buildings on the outskirts of your base, you can distract the hostile bots and buy time for your defenses to take them out.

### Conclusion

These new enemies add an extra layer of challenge to your Fulgoran adventure. They force you to think beyond simple weapon damage and consider the layout and logistics of your defenses. We believe they complement the unique mechanics of the planet well, tying into themes of recycling, energy management, and adaptive problem-solving.

Of course, we're still fine-tuning the balance and behaviors of these new threats. Your feedback will be crucial in ensuring they provide a fun and fair challenge for all players.
